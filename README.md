# Setup
Because I implemented the in-memory database with python you can simply run "python database.py" in the command line to test the code. I created an InMemoryDB class which sits above the main method.
To test functionality you can edit the main method and call whichever functions you like in whichever order. I have a basic test already set up (which throws no exceptions).

# Assignment Suggestions
I think this assignment is setup well, I like that you can use the language of your choosing. A suggestion for grading would be a given defined test case that must pass. Also, for ease of testing/grading,
maybe specify that exceptions can be written as warnings so that you can verify handling without having to restart the test and comment out the improper lines of code.
